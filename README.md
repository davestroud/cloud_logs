# AWS Log Data Anomaly Detection and Autonomous Remediation System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system for detecting anomalies in AWS log data (CloudWatch, CloudTrail, etc.), predicting potential system failures, and autonomously resolving issues to improve cloud service uptime and reliability.

The system uses:
- **Anomaly Detection** for structured AWS log data (e.g., EC2, Lambda, S3, VPC logs).
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for analyzing unstructured log messages.
- **Autonomous AI Agents** to take corrective actions based on anomaly detection.

## Objectives

### 1. Anomaly Detection: Structured Log Data Analysis
Identify unusual patterns or activities in AWS log data across services like EC2, Lambda, S3, and VPC to:
- Predict potential system failures.
- Flag suspicious activities that deviate from established baselines.

### 2. LLM-Based Text Log Analysis: Unstructured Data
Apply LLMs to unstructured log messages to:
- Understand the semantics of error logs.
- Identify patterns in error messages.
- Extract potential root causes for system failures.

### 3. Autonomous AI Agents
Define and deploy AI agents that autonomously:
- Detect anomalies.
- Take predefined corrective actions (e.g., restarting instances, throttling services).
- Improve system reliability and uptime.

## Data Sources

- **EC2 Logs**: Monitor SSH login attempts, CPU usage, disk warnings, and system processes.
- **Lambda Logs**: Track function invocations, errors, memory usage, and timeouts.
- **S3 Access Logs**: Analyze HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) and access patterns.
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Monitor network traffic (source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and actions like ACCEPT/REJECT).

Each log type includes a consistent set of pre-defined users (`userIdentity` and `principalId`) to trace activities across multiple AWS services.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Log Parsing**: Extract relevant fields (e.g., timestamps, user info, event types).
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Time-series aggregation with sliding windows.
  - Statistical and contextual feature creation (e.g., error counts, instance types).
- **Data Labeling** (if necessary): Label known anomalies for supervised learning or use clustering algorithms for unsupervised anomaly detection.

## Model Development

### Anomaly Detection Models
- **Traditional ML Models**: Random Forests, Isolation Forests, SVMs.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Autoencoders, LSTM (for time-series data).
- **Time-Series Models**: Prophet, ARIMA for forecasting and deviation detection.

### LLM-Based Models
- Fine-tune pre-trained models like GPT or BERT to analyze unstructured log messages.
- Use Hugging Face's Transformers library for fine-tuning and inference.

## Autonomous AI Agents for Remediation

### Action Definition
- Predefine actions (e.g., restart instances, clear caches) for detected anomalies.
- Train reinforcement learning agents using frameworks like **Ray RLlib** or **OpenAI Gym**.

### AI Agent Deployment
- Deploy AI agents in **AWS Lambda** to automatically resolve issues based on detected anomalies.

## Model Optimization

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use **AWS SageMaker** for optimization.
- **Cross-Validation**: Apply time-series cross-validation techniques.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track model metrics using **AWS CloudWatch** (e.g., inference latency, precision/recall).

## Real-Time Deployment and Integration

- **AWS Lambda**: Deploy anomaly detection models in Lambda for real-time analysis.
- **AWS EventBridge**: Trigger Lambda functions for real-time predictions and AI agent actions.
- **Kubernetes**: Use **AWS EKS** for scaling and **Kubeflow** for orchestration.
- **API Gateway**: Expose inference API via **AWS API Gateway** for integration with external services.

## System Monitoring and Logging

- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitor logs and system performance.
- **Amazon SNS**: Set up alerts for anomalies or agent actions.
- **Grafana**: Visualize model performance metrics (e.g., anomaly frequency, agent success rates).

## Continuous Learning & Model Updating

- **Active Learning**: Implement a pipeline for continuous retraining with newly resolved logs.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Use **AWS CodePipeline** or **GitHub Actions** for continuous deployment.

## Documentation and Reporting

- **System Performance Tracking**: Log and display anomaly detection metrics, agent actions, and overall system reliability.
- **Stakeholder Reports**: Generate insights on system failures, trends, and uptime improvements.
