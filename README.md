# Cloud Logs: Anomaly Detection and AI-Driven Resolution

## Problem Scope
Develop a system that uses machine learning models to detect anomalies in AWS log data (e.g., CloudWatch logs, CloudTrail logs), predict potential system failures, and autonomously resolve issues. The primary goal is to enhance service uptime and reliability by combining anomaly detection and AI agent frameworks.

## Objectives
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns or activities in AWS log data (EC2, Lambda, S3, VPC) to predict potential system failures and flag suspicious activities.
- **LLM Analysis (Future Innovation)**: Apply language models (LLMs) to analyze unstructured log messages, extract potential root causes of system failures, and understand log semantics.

## Data Description
We will use a consistent set of 10 unique users, generating logs over a year with 100,000 samples. These logs will include:

### EC2 Logs
- Capture login attempts, system processes, security warnings, and resource usage.
- Introduce failed login attempts from unusual IPs for anomaly detection.
- Simulate suspicious commands, unexpected package installations, and abnormal disk usage.

### Lambda Logs
- Include timeouts, memory limits, processing errors, and abnormal API request patterns.
- Simulate spikes in requests or memory usage to detect potential attacks or bugs.

### S3 Access Logs
- Track user actions with various HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) and responses (200, 403).
- Simulate unusual access patterns like multiple downloads of sensitive files or unauthorized access attempts.

### VPC Flow Logs
- Monitor network activity, identifying suspicious connections, DDoS attempts, or scans from untrusted IPs.
- Include unusual protocols or high traffic from internal IPs indicating potential system compromise.

### Additional Anomalies
- Introduce time-based anomalies where user behaviors change suddenly.
- Simulate account-wide anomalies like spikes in activity across services.
- Include region-based anomalies, indicating operations from unusual geographic locations.

## Data Preprocessing
1. **Log Parsing**: Extract relevant fields (e.g., timestamp, user ID, event type) and convert logs into CSV format for easier processing.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Time-Series Aggregation**: Use sliding windows or session-based slicing to capture log sequences.
   - **Statistical Features**: Count anomalies, errors, or unusual patterns over time.
   - **Contextual Features**: Add context like instance type or user profile.

## Model Development
- **Anomaly Detection Models**:
  - **Traditional ML Approaches**: We will be using XGBoost for this problem.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - **Autoencoders**: Train to reconstruct normal log sequences; large reconstruction errors indicate anomalies.
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Learn sequential patterns in time-series logs to detect deviations.
- **Time-Series Models**: Use Prophet or ARIMA for forecasting and detecting deviations.

## Model Optimization
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize hyperparameter optimization tools for fine-tuning.
- **Cross-Validation**: Implement time-series cross-validation to avoid overfitting.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track model performance for inference latency and accuracy.

## Real-Time Deployment and Integration
- **Integration with Cloud Compute Services**:
  - Deploy models for real-time anomaly detection.
  - Trigger Lambda functions for predictions and AI agent actions.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: For scaling, deploy models for orchestrating model training and deployment.
- **API Gateway**: Expose model inference API for integration with other services or UIs.

## System Monitoring and Logging
- Monitor the system for performance insights.
- Set up alerts for detected anomalies or autonomous agent actions.

## Continuous Learning & Model Updating
- Implement an Active Learning pipeline to retrain models with new logs resolved by agents.
- Use CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for continuous deployment of updated models.

## Documentation and Reporting
- Develop documentation and dashboards to track:
  - System performance: number of detected anomalies, success rate of autonomous actions, overall reliability.
- Generate reports on system failures, trends, and uptime improvements for stakeholders.
